## Overview {-}

Have you ever had a disagreement with someone over what the correct ethical
action or point of view is in a certain situation? Perhaps, for example, a
person who has murdered three people and terrorized your community for the past
four months has just been arrested and found guilty with overwhelming evidence.
You say justice requires that this person be executed but your friend staunchly
disagrees. She argues that killing humans is wrong in all situations because
human life has intrinsic value and dignity regardless of what any person has
done.
Another example: you and a friend disagree about whether you should tell a lie to your employer in order to save a colleague’s job who has been unfairly accused of padding her expense account. It’s a complicated situation but by telling one small lie, you can lift the suspicion from your colleague. “Of course you should lie!” your friend confidently asserts. “After all, it would be a gross injustice for her to be fired for something she didn’t do, and what harm is there is telling the lie to prevent that injustice?” You, however, are not so sure that lying is really that harmless.
Disagreements like this can arise over a host of morally perplexing dilemmas and when they do, we sometimes wonder how to resolve them.

This is the question we will be addressing in this unit, i.e., **how can we decide what good ethical behaviour is when we are faced with tough ethical choices?** Is there a procedure, or set of procedures, we can follow to help provide ethical guidance for the perplexing moral questions we all face from time to time? In other words, what does morality call us to do in these tough situations and how can we determine that?

There are three common theories of morality which set out answers to this question: **Justice as Fairness, Utilitarianism,** and **The Categorical Imperative**. In this unit we will read articles setting out each of these theories along with a basic rationale for each.

## Topics {-}

This unit is divided into 3 topics:

-   Wolff, Jonathan.  *Readings in Moral Philosophy*.  New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2018.  
-   Other online resources will be provided in the unit.  

### Understanding the Original Position {-}

How can we decide what good ethical behaviour is when we are faced with tough
ethical choices? One answer, or theory of morality, called **‘Justice as
Fairness’**, holds that the morally good, or just, course of action is the one
which is the fairest in the situation. How, though, do we figure out what is
fair, especially in a way that others will agree with us? How could anyone
figure out a thing like that?
Interestingly, John Rawls, a twentieth century American political philosopher, and an advocate of this view, has developed a well-known thought experiment to help us do precisely that. We will read about it in the article by him in our course readings for this unit. Be ready to figure out what he meant by such key terms as **the original position** and **veil of ignorance**. Without a clear grasp of these, we will not understand this thought experiment or Rawls’ method.
We may need to read over certain parts a few times to really grasp these key concepts but, given the importance of preparing to face tough moral dilemmas, it will be worth the effort. We’ll also have opportunities to discuss them with colleagues in this class to help gain a working knowledge of them. In the end, let’s try to answer the question for ourselves: How can I determine what is moral?

### Learning Activities {-}

<!--

## Topic 2: Utilitarianism {-}

**Introduction**
Another answer to the question of how to determine what is moral is called **utilitarianism**. This view teaches that morally good actions are those that, on balance, bring about the greatest good or happiness in any given situation. This theory seems rather intuitive to many people and, not surprisingly, has been around for a long time. Nineteenth century British philosopher, John Stuart Mill, its best known representative, has written the article we’ll read to see how he develops it.
As you’re reading his article, ask yourself if you can think of any problems with it. Serious objections have been raised against this view which is why many people have preferred the next answer we will consider.

### The Categorical Imperative {-}

Our third answer to the question of how to determine what is morally good action was set out by the eighteenth-century German philosopher, Immanuel Kant. He rejected utilitarianism and took an entirely different approach. His theory is that the morality of any action does not depend on its consequences or effects because those same effects, namely happiness and pleasure, could be produced by a whole variety of actions, many of which would not be just. In other words, happiness and pleasure are unreliable guides to determining morally just actions.
Rather, he said, the morality of an action depends upon whether it fulfills our duty to follow ethical rules. What rules? Kant said we can develop rules which are drawn from one supreme principle of morality which he called **The Categorical Imperative**. His moral system is often called duty-based, or rule-based ethics, as opposed to the consequence-based ethics of utilitarianism. As we read the article by this philosopher, let’s see what we think about this way of determining morally just action.

#### Diamond Case Study {-}

Read the following case study and consider what you would do in the situation.
What ethical issues arise?
You, a follower of utilitarian ethics and a poor college student, are enjoying an evening visiting with two friends.  One is a parent of seven children with limited financial means who holds to Immanuel Kant’s categorical imperative, while the other is a wealthy business owner who happens to be a follower of John Rawls’ theory of justice built around the concept of the original position.  Your topic of discussion is the relative merits of these three ethical concepts. Suddenly someone enters the room with a small box of valuable diamonds and says they have been donated to your group of three by a wealthy philanthropist who wishes to remain anonymous. The donor asked that they be divided “justly” among you but has left the definition of justice up to you.  How would each of you say they should be divided? How does each ethical concept, the categorical imperative, the original position, and utilitarianism influence each answer?

### Assessment {-}

<!-- [plugin:content-inject](../_Assignment1) -->

```{block2, type='assessment'}

#### Assignment: Ethics Committee Response (20%) {-}

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to
meet with your Ethics Committee and discuss the following:

For the following ethical theories, Justice as fairness, the categorical imperative, and utilitarianism, explain the answer you think an advocate of each position would give to the following question:

*Should the government provide housing and a food allowance for homeless people?*

As you meet with your Ethics Committee this week, discuss the question and provide some of the key reasoning you think each perspective would use in coming to what they believe to be a just solution. In other words, the utilitarian would point out. . . and say. . ., etc.

In your response, work with key terms and concepts from your readings. (eg. *If I was a ….I would say...about this case.*)

Submit your report on Moodle by the end of the week.


<!-- [plugin:content-inject](../_Assignment2) -->

#### Assignment: Reflective Journal (ungraded practice) {-}

For your second Reflective Journal in this course, you are invited to write about what you have learned in this unit. Remember that you should consider your journal as a place for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and to possibly share what you are learning with your community.
After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write a 250-400 word journal entry responding to the following question: “Why Be Moral?”

#### Discussion Responses {-}

After you have finished your journal assignment, you will share your responses in class with your peers. You will then be asked to add 1-2 more ideas to your journal response, highlighting what you learned from the discussion with your peers.

```
