Topic 3: Hookup Culture
-----------------------
Date rape does not happen in isolation. It occurs within a social context, and a key feature of the current social context is described by the term, **hookup culture.** This term is introduced to us by Conor Kelly in the article we will read by her for this topic. It refers to the practice of engaging in sexual activity with no expectation by either party of a longer-term relationship.
As Kelly points out, hookup culture is increasingly accepted in our world. What we may not have noticed, however, is that it raises a key ethical question, one that she puts to us from the perspective of feminist ethics: **Does hookup culture represent a step forward for women’s rights or is it, by nature, sexist and anti-women?** Is it an expression of increased freedom and equality, or does it, in effect, treat women as simply means used by men to have more free sex with no strings attached?
As we read Kelly’s article, let’s understand the concept of hookup culture and wrestle with this question. We’ll have an opportunity to see what this cultural practice means for the task of determining helpful guiding principles to apply to the maze of questions surrounding date rape.
