### Assignment: Ethics Committee Response (ungraded practice)

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to
analyze a case with your Ethics Committee.
!!! This week, your committee has been asked to discuss a problem going on at the local high school.  There have been recent reports of date rape occurring, and parents and school leaders are deeply concerned. Discuss how and why date rape can lead to difficult moral dilemmas.  How is date rape different from any other kind of rape and what are the complicating factors added by the introduction of alcohol into the situation?  What concepts or principles could provide help in solving these dilemmas? In your responses, work with key terms and concepts from the course reading. At the end of your discussion, come up with some key steps which could help the school develop a policy on sexual consent.
As you meet with your Ethics Committee this week, discuss the case above and take notes as a group.
