#### Activity 6.4: Stuck in the Middle Case Study

Read the following case and consider the questions presented.
!!! A long-time friend phones you and tells you she was raped last night on a date with another friend of yours.  When you call the other friend, he is shocked to hear she is using the term, rape. He claims that she led him on and he really thought she was “into it.”  After all, they had been drinking and touching throughout the evening at her place. Even though she seemed reluctant at one point, in the end she went along with it.  It so happens that you have just completed the course reading for this unit so you might be thinking of the complexities of the situation and the individual perspectives of both people.
Based on the readings for this unit, what questions arise?  What questions should the people involved be asking themselves? What are bound to be the most difficult complicating factors in this discussion?  
*Note that you may be asked to review this case or similar cases in your class discussion groups. You may want to prepare by relating the case to your readings. Specifically, identify the ethical issues and terms to help explain the case.*
