#### Assignment: Ethics Committee Response (ungraded practice)

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to
analyze a case from the perspectives of a nihilist, moral subjectivist, moral
objectivist, free will advocate, determinist, and compatibilist.

For this practice Ethics Committee meeting, you will discuss the following case:

!!! You discover your supervisor has been involved in an unethical activity, as she has been padding her expense account with substantial amounts. Your supervisor knows you know what she has done.  Are you complicit? What do you do? Should you report this unethical activity? What would be the consequences for you and for your superior? From the perspective of a nihilist, moral subjectivist, moral objectivist, free will advocate, determinist, and compatibilist, what might you do?


As you meet with your Ethics Committee this week, discuss the case above and
take notes as a group. In your response, work with key terms and concepts from
your readings. (eg. *If I was a ….I would say...about this case.*)
