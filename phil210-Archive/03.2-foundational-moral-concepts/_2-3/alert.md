#### Activity 2.3: Read, View and Reflect

Read Chapter 4 in the Wolff *Introduction* text (pages 58-69). As you read this
chapter, ask yourself if our instinctive belief in free will is a sufficient
basis for continuing to believe we really do act freely. Also, reflect on the
reasons given for the various kinds of determinism and ask yourself whether it
is possible to believe in both *determinism* and *moral responsibility*.

Next, watch the following videos to learn more about key terms from this
chapter.
