### Assignment: Reflective Journal (20%)

Throughout this course, you will be invited to write about what you are learning
in a Reflective Journal. You should consider your journal as a place for you to
try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and possibly share what you are
learning with your community. For more on Reflective Journaling, see the
following [resource](Reflective_Journaling.pdf).

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write 250-300 word reflection that compares and contrasts the different perspectives covered in this unit (nihilist, moral subjectivist, moral objectivist, free will advocate, determinist, and compatibilist) and how these perspectives would impact how one might respond to an unethical activity.
