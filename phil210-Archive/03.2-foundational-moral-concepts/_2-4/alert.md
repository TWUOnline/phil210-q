#### Activity 2.4: Facebook Case Study

Read the following case study and consider what you would do in the situation.
What ethical issues arise?

!!! As a manager, you discover that one of your employees is on Facebook during the workday. Whether it is a quick check for messages or spending minutes reading the news feed, this constitutes stealing from the company. Â What should you do as a manager and why? What perspectives should you consider and why? For example, consider how your response to this situation may vary depending upon whether you think moral value is objectively true or only subjectively true. What are the consequences of the actions you feel you must take?


*Note that you may be asked to review this case or similar cases in your class
discussion groups. You may want to prepare by relating the case to your
readings. Specifically, identify the ethical issues and terms to help explain
the case.*
