#### Activity 2.1: Read, View and Reflect

In the first activity, you are asked to read the first part of Chapter 3 (pages
40-44) of your textbook, *An Introduction to Moral Philosophy* by Jonathan
Wolff. As you read be sure to take notes in your Learning Journal, defining key
terms and explaining key concepts. Study the chapter review summary, questions
and key terms. This will help you as you complete the assessments in this
course.
Next, watch the following short videos to learn more about the term, moral
nihilism.
