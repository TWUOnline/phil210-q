Topic 1: Moral Nihilism
-----------------------

In this topic we’re turning to a viewpoint which you may find surprising,
namely, moral nihilism. Most of us have probably used the terms, nihilism or
nihilist, before but what does the term, moral nihilism, refer to? If someone
calls you a moral nihilist, what are they saying about you and your moral
values? Should you be happy or unhappy to be labelled this way?

The word, nihilism, comes from a Latin word meaning “nothing,” and thus moral nihilism is the view that nothing is intrinsically or universally right or wrong. In other words, we may *prefer* or *like* certain actions more than others, but nothing that we, or anyone else does, is truly morally good or bad. Even an act like rape or murder is not wrong, in itself, but neither is it right since nothing is intrinsically right or wrong.

How, then, does a moral nihilist view the moral rules or traditions of any given society? According to this view, people may find it useful to create, follow, and teach rules and traditions in their societies. After all, what society could get along without them? But they are nothing more than traditions which could have been different if other ones would have been deemed more useful. In this sense they are arbitrary.

Does anyone really embrace moral nihilism? Why would they? For this topic, read
the Wolff *Introduction* text to gain a fuller understanding of this view. See
if you can figure out one or two reasons for holding this view.
