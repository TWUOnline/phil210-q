#### Activity 10.6: Ethics Committee Response (ungraded)

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to
meet with your Ethics Committee one more time and discuss the following:

!!! A local government task force on foreign aid has contacted your Ethics committee and asked for your recommendations concerning the question of whether to raise local taxes to send food and clothes to mud slide victims in South America.  As a committee, begin by brainstorming about the basis provided by Peter Singer for our moral obligation to provide assistance to others in need.

In your discussion, include issues such as the relevance (or irrelevance) of the physical proximity of the recipients of our aid, the traditional distinction between duty and charity, and the place of population control. Then, drawing upon Dambisa Moyo’s article, discuss ways of critiquing Singer’s argument for this moral obligation.

As you meet with your Ethics Committee this week, discuss the case above and take notes as a group.
