#### Activity 10.3: Webquest for Help!
Go online and search for foreign aid organizations. What is their philosophy or approach to helping people? See for example the Habitat for Humanity website at <https://www.habitat.ca/>. How do they help people? Can you discern their reasons for doing so from their website? Of the views of helping weâ€™ve discussed so far in this unit, which view do you think these actions support and why?
