Topic 2: Does our aid help or hurt?
------------------------------------
Can we really disagree with Singer’s conclusion to his child-in-the-pond analogy? One person who offers a very different perspective is Zambian economist, Dambisa Moyo. In our second reading selection, we’ll see her argument. You may find it surprising.
Moyo makes a distinction between **humanitarian aid** and **development aid** and argues that development aid has actually been tried and proven to be ineffective, even harmful, in many parts of the world. Overall, she asserts, it has actually done more harm than good and has left people worse off than they would have been without the aid. To make matters worse, it has slowed development and progress rather than enhanced it.
These are strong claims and we will have an opportunity to consider whether we agree with her use of the facts, her reasoning, and conclusions? If so, has she shown that Singer’s case is flawed and his conclusion about a moral basis, mistaken, or could both he and she be correct?
