Topic 3: How to think about moral obligation to those in need.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Since questions concerning our moral obligation to needy people involve their very lives and well-being, it is important to ask if there are better or worse ways to reason and investigate this question. In our third reading selection, Onora O’Neill, an Irish moral and political philosopher, and expert in Kantian moral philosophy, raises exactly this question. O’Neill moves beyond the debate about the existence of a moral obligation and suggests that various moral theories, but especially Kantian moral theory, can guide our thinking on the issues of hunger and our obligation concerning it. How can it help?
Kantian moral philosophy, she says, shifts our focus from the **results** of various actions we might take to the **kinds of actions** we might carry out.
More specifically, it urges the kinds of actions which adhere to Immanuel Kant’s famous ethical principle, **the categorical imperative.** This principle states in one of its forms that we should always treat other people as ends in themselves, and never merely as means to our own personal ends.
When we apply this principle to the question at hand, it means, says O’Neill, that the actions we take concerning humanitarian and development aid must be the kind that help those who receive the aid take control of their own lives and, whenever possible, gain the ability to create their own best solutions to their situations.
Her argument is important because, if she is correct, it means that a number of humanitarian and aid programs can be criticized for the kinds of actions they take. We will have opportunity to discuss her proposal with class colleagues to see if we agree with her and, if not, why not.
