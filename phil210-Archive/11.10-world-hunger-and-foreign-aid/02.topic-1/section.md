Topic 1: A Proposed Basis for Moral Obligation
----------------------------------------------
Do we have a moral obligation to help others? Our first task in unpacking this question is to see why some ethicists think that people who *can* help *should* do so, why they have a *moral obligation* to help? How does one establish a basis for such an obligation?

American philosopher, Peter Singer, sets out a basis for moral obligation which he believes most reasonable people would agree with, and we will read about it in our first reading selection.

Singer presents an intriguing analogy of a professor on his way to class who suddenly sees a young child drowning in a pond. Should he stop and save the drowning child? If he does, he will not only ruin his suit and shoes, but also miss class and cheat the waiting students out of the teaching time for which they have paid. These sacrifices, however, are miniscule compared to the value of a child’s life and, therefore says Singer, the professor *should* jump in and save the child. He is morally obligated to do so.

Singer believes that no reasonable person would disagree with this conclusion. He then states a principle which, he believes, can be derived from this child-in-the-pond analogy: **If we are able to prevent something bad from happening without, thereby, sacrificing something of comparable value, we should do so**.

He adds a few other elements to his theory along the way and, as we come to understand this principle, it will be important to ask ourselves whether we agree with it because his entire case rests on it. Let’s also think about possible objections to his view because, as noted earlier, his perspective is only one of three we will consider. We’ll get to the other two views in the next topic, but for now, let’s explore singer’s argument further.
