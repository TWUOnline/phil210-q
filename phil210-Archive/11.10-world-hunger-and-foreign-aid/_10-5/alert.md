#### Activity 10.5: Case Study
Read Peter Singer’s famous analogy of the drowning child in the pond (found on p. 612-13, 617 of the course readings text).  Do you agree with his conclusion that you have a moral obligation to save the child if you can? Do you also agree with the principle he draws from this analogy, i.e., that if we are able to prevent something bad from happening without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable value, we ought morally to do it.  Why or why not? Finally, drawing upon Onora O’Neill’s article, comment on how both a utilitarian and an advocate of Kant’s principle that humans ought to be treated as ends and not merely as means to others’ ends, would evaluate Singer’s principle.
*Note that you may be asked to review this case or similar cases in your class discussion groups. You may want to prepare by relating the case to your readings. Specifically, identify the ethical issues and terms to help explain the case.*
