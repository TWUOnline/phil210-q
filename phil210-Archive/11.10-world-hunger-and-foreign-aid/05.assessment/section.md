Checking your Learning
----------------------
Before you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to:
-   Explain Peter Singer’s reasons for believing that people who are able to help others meet their basic needs have a moral obligation to do so.
-   Discuss the view that the difference in physical proximity of the people needing aid is a morally insignificant difference.
-   Explain why Dambisa Moyo thinks foreign aid sometimes does more harm than good for the people it is intended to help.
-   Discuss ways in which Kant’s principle of treating people as ends in themselves can clarify and guide our discussion of the question of our duty to provide aid to others.
