Topic 3: How to reason ethically about Capital Punishment
---------------------------------------------------------
In the previous topic, we learned how one thinker reasons in defense of capital punishment. Could it be, however, that neither side on this issue has conclusive arguments. That is the view of Hugo Bedau, an American political philosopher who has written an article we will read for this topic.
How, then, should one proceed in figuring out this issue? Bedau contends that, since neither those who argue **for** or **against** bring overwhelming supporting arguments, a better way forward is to shift our focus to the **goals** of punishment in the first place.
In other words, according to Bedau, the first question to ask is not whether capital punishment is ever morally justified, but rather, **what we are trying to accomplish by punishing** those who have committed vile crimes. Why do we punish them? What do we hope will be the outcome of our punishment? Different answers may be given to this question. Let’s read Bedau’s article to see how he answers it, and then see if this provides help in answering the larger question concerning the morality of capital punishment.
