#### Activity 8.4: Case Study

Read the following case study and consider the questions presented.
!!! Analyze James Rachels’ ‘Smith and Jones’ example from his article in the course readings.  Drawing upon the arguments from all the readings for this unit, tell whether you agree with his conclusion that this example shows that in cases like this, killing a person is no worse morally than letting that same person die, that these two actions are morally equivalent?  Why or why not? Then explain why Don Marquis would probably disagree with Rachels’ conclusion.
*Note that you may be asked to review this case or similar cases in your class discussion groups. You may want to prepare by relating the case to your readings. Specifically, identify the ethical issues and terms to help explain the case.*
