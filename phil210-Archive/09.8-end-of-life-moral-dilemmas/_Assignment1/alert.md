### Assignment: Reflective Journal (5%)
After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write about what you have learned in this unit.
State John Stuart Mill’s case for the moral permissibility of capital punishment and show how it grows out of his utilitarian perspective.  Then explain a number of questions Hugo Bedau would raise about the argument made by Mill. Tell why, in the end, he would favour the abolition of capital punishment.  Finally, discuss which view, Bedau’s or Mill’s, you would prefer and why.
#### Discussion Responses
After you have finished your journal assignment, you will share your responses in class with your peers. Refer to the **grading criteria** in the Assessments section of this course. Be sure to include your initial journal response, as well as ideas from your class discussion. Submit your assignment on Moodle by the end of the week.
