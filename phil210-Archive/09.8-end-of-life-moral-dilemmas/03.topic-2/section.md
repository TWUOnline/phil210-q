Topic 2: Capital Punishment: A Defense
--------------------------------------
The issue of capital punishment presents us with a starkly different kind of end-of-life ethical question. We are no longer considering our best course of action toward our loved ones who are suffering or dying. Rather we are asking how someone who has committed vile crimes should be treated by their governments.
Specifically, we are asking whether there are cases in which justice would allow for, or even require, a state to execute such a person. The challenge for all of us is to move beyond how we may feel toward people who have committed atrocious crimes, especially if they were against one of our loved ones, and ask if principles of justice would call for their execution.
We will read a well-known case in favour of capital punishment by John Stuart Mill who argues on utilitarian grounds that having this option available will lead to better consequences for a society than ruling it out. It will be important for us to consider his arguments and see whether we agree with him or not.
