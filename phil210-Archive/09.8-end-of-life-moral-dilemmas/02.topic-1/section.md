Topic 1: Active & Passive Euthanasia
------------------------------------
**Active euthanasia** occurs when steps are taken to euthanize a person, perhaps by giving a lethal injection or an overdose of pain-killers. **Passive euthanasia** happens when life-saving medical equipment is either withheld or withdrawn from a person with the intention of letting that person die from their underlying disease or condition.
Are active and passive euthanasia morally equivalent to each other? In other words, is one of these just as good (or bad) as the other, or is one morally worse than the other? How does one decide a question like this?
Related to this question is the distinction between **killing** and **letting die**. Most of us would probably instinctively view killing as morally worse than letting die, but in the reading by American ethicist, James Rachels, we will have an opportunity to think through this question and test our moral intuitions.
If all other factors were the same, asks Rachels, such as our motives and purposes in acting, would killing a person be morally worse than letting that same person die? His answer may surprise you. The way we reply to this question will have far-reaching implications for our views concerning passive euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.
