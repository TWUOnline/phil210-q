## Topic 1: Developing a Moral Outlook
-----------------------------------

Moral ideas and teachings are not really new to any of us, whether we have ever taken a course in ethics or not. We have all been taught from our earliest days to obey our parents, respect our elders, be kind to children, and a host of other moral instructions. In other words, ethics have been part of our lives from the beginning.

The process of developing a moral outlook begins by considering whether moral questions matter and, if they do, how we can develop attitudes that are sensitive to them. Does it matter whether I live one way or another, whether I help people or hurt them, lie to my neighbours or tell them the truth, respect other people’s property or take it at will so long as I can get away with it?

When someone tells you that stealing your colleague’s wallet was wrong and you reply by asking, “Why should I care about that?” you have commented on the necessity, or lack thereof, of a moral outlook.

One key area of study involved in developing a moral outlook is **meta-ethics,** which involves foundational questions of the nature of morality, how we know moral rules, etc. Another is **normative ethics** which is the study of what we are morally obligated to do. A third is **applied ethics** which moves one into the analysis of specific moral questions. In this topic, it will be important to understand the differences between these terms.
