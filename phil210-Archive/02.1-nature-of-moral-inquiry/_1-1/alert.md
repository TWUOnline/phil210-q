#### Activity 1.1: Introductions
Before you delve into the course material, take some time to introduce yourself to your peers, your facilitator, and your instructor. Share a bit about yourself, such as where you live, what you are studying, the kind of things that interest you, and perhaps some questions you have about this course. Feel free to share a picture of something that means something to you (e.g. pet, family, favourite book, etc.).
Note that in this course, you will write reflective journals and participate in other group assignments. This is a good opportunity to get to know each other and build your community of learners.

Go to the Course Cafe section and click on Student Introductions.  Add your introduction to the forum.
