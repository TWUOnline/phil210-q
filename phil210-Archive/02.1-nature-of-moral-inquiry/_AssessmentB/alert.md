#### Assignment: Ethics Committee Response (20%)

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to
analyze the following case. You will work with a group of your peers, assuming the role of an Ethics
Committee. This committee will meet throughout this course to
discuss issues and create a summary report. Two reports are ungraded practice, and three reports are graded for a total of 45% of your course grade.

For this first Ethics Committee meeting, you will discuss the following case:

!!! A local manufacturing plant in your community has been accused by a citizens group of dumping waste into a nearby river. When confronted with this issue, the manufacturing company president responded by saying, “We’re not dumping that much in and we’re not hurting anyone.” Others in the community disagree and believe this practice by the manufacturing plant is harming the environment.

In topic 2 of this unit, four steps are set out for working through moral situations like this one. For this Ethics committee report, first figure out what questions you would need to ask the company and what information you would need. Then follow just the first two of the four steps.

· Step 1: identify the precise moral question needing to be resolved, and

· Step 2: state a few possible answers to this question.

Finally, tell which of the answers in step 2 your committee is recommending and why.

As you meet with your Ethics Committee this week, discuss the case above and
take notes as a group. In your response, work with key terms and concepts from
your readings. (eg. *If I was a ….I would say...about this case.*)

Submit your report on Moodle by the end of the week.
