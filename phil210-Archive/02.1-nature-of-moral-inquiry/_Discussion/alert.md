### Discussion Responses

After you have finished your journal assignment, you will share your responses in class with your peers. You will then be asked to share 1-2 more ideas in your journal response, highlighting what you learned from the discussion with your peers.
As you discuss, be sure to respond substantively.

*Substantive responses may include:*
-   Providing a new thought, idea, or perspective;
-   Citing an experience or example of what we are learning;
-   Adding a new twist on a perspective;
-   Critically thinking about an idea/concept;
-   Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective;
-   Asking a question or making a comment that shows you are interested in what
    another person says or encourages another person to elaborate on something
    they have already said;
-   Sharing a resource (a reading, web link, video) not covered in the syllabus
    that adds new information or perspectives to our learning;
-   Making a comment that underscores the link between two people’s
    contributions and making this link explicit in your comment. Or making a
    summary observation that takes into account several people’s contributions
    and that touches on a recurring theme in the discussion.


What Substantive Participation is **NOT:**
-   Very basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree;”
-   Restating what has been said *(unless there is a direct purpose in doing
    so);*
-   Disrespectfully disagreeing;
-   Pat answers that are not thought-provoking or do not move the dialogue
    forward;
Below are examples of how to stimulate your own and others’ thinking:
-   What would happen if…
-   Other times it may be helpful to…
-   It is my understanding…what is your experience with this?
-   You might approach this from…
-   Is it possible that…
-   Would you consider…
-   Maybe…
-   Possibly…
-   Sometimes…
-   I’m wondering if…
-   Do you think…
