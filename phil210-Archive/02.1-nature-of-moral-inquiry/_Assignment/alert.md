      Ethics Committee Questions
      Unit 2: (5%)
      After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to analyze a case from the perspectives of a nihilist, moral subjectivist, moral objectivist, free will advocate, determinist, and compatibilist.
      You will work with a group of your peers, assuming the role of an Ethics Committee.  This committee will meet six times throughout this course to discuss issues and then post a summary report online. Each report is worth 5%, for a total of 30% of your course grade.
      For this first Ethics Committee meeting, you will discuss the following case:

      You discover your supervisor has been involved in an unethical activity, as she has been padding her expense account with substantial amounts. Your supervisor knows you know what she has done.  Are you complicit?  What do you do?  Should you report this unethical activity? What would be the consequences for you and for your superior? From the perspective of a nihilist, moral subjectivist, moral objectivist, free will advocate, determinist, and compatibilist, what might you do?



      As you meet with your Ethics Committee this week, discuss the case above and take notes as a group. In your response, work with key terms and concepts from your readings. (eg. If I was a ….I would say...about this case.)

      Submit your report on Moodle by the end of the week.



      Unit 3: (5%)
      After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to analyze Plato’s story of the Ring of Gyges from various perspectives. You will work again with your Ethics Committee group to discuss the case and then post a summary report online.
      For this Ethics Committee meeting, analyze Plato’s story of the Ring of Gyges (from the text reading, p. 88) and state how his key question, “What would you do?” might be answered by an ethical egoist, a psychological egoist, an advocate of self-interest morality, and a kin altruist.  Then explain why you think each would answer as they do.  (e.g.  If I was a ….I would say...  Here is why.)

      As you meet with your Ethics Committee this week, discuss the story and take notes. In your response, work with key terms and concepts from your readings. (eg. If I was a ….I would say...about this case.)

      Should the government provide housing and a food allowance for homeless people?  

      As you meet with your Ethics Committee this week, discuss the question and provide some of the key reasoning you think each perspective would use in coming to what they believe to be a just solution.  In other words, the utilitarian would point out. . . and say. . ., etc.

      In your response, work with key terms and concepts from your readings. (eg. If I was a ….I would say...about this case.)

PHIL 210 Assessment: Reflective Journal (30%)
Throughout this course, you will be invited to write about what you are learning in a Reflective Journal. You should consider your journal as a place for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and possibly share what you are learning with your community.  

This assessment is worth 30% of your course grade. You will complete a Reflective Journal entry for Units 1, 4, 7, 8, and 9 (6% each).

Instructions:
There are three steps to submitting your Reflective Journal:
Step 1: Respond to the questions presented in the unit.
Step 2: Discuss your reflections in class. Take notes on key learning from the discussion.
Step 3: Submit your final Reflective Journal entry to your professor via the Moodle assignment dropbox.  Be sure to include any final ideas you learned through the class discussions.

Guidelines for Discussion Responses
Bring your Reflective Journal to class and share your responses with your peers. Take notes, as you will need to share 1-2 more ideas in your journal response, highlighting what you learned from the discussion with your peers.

As you discuss, be sure to respond substantively.
Substantive responses may include:
•	Providing a new thought, idea, or perspective;
•	Citing an experience or example of what we are learning;
•	Adding a new twist on a perspective;
•	Critically thinking about an idea/concept;
•	Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective;
•	Asking a question or making a comment that shows you are interested in what another person says or encourages another person to elaborate on something they have already said;
•	Sharing a resource (a reading, web link, video) not covered in the syllabus that adds new information or perspectives to our learning;
•	Making a comment that underscores the link between two people’s contributions and making this link explicit in your comment. Or making a summary observation that takes into account several people’s contributions and that touches on a recurring theme in the discussion.

What Substantive Participation is NOT:
•	Very basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree;”
•	Restating what has been said (unless there is a direct purpose in doing so);
•	Disrespectfully disagreeing;
•	Pat answers that are not thought-provoking or do not move the dialogue forward;

Below are examples of how to stimulate your own and others’ thinking:
•	What would happen if…
•	Other times it may be helpful to…
•	It is my understanding…what is your experience with this?
•	You might approach this from…
•	Is it possible that…
•	Would you consider…
•	Maybe…
•	Possibly…
•	Sometimes…
•	I’m wondering if…
•	Do you think…

Assignment Submission
Assignments should be submitted on Moodle by the end of the week (confirm date with your Facilitator). Be sure to include your initial journal response, as well as ideas from your class discussion.

Then show how he believes his view follows from a utilitarian perspective.  Following that, analyze his view and formulate two searching questions you think he would need to answer to defend his view further.  Finally, tell how you think a different utilitarian thinker could argue against the moral permissibility of torture?


PHIL 210 Assessment: Partner Project Presentation (30%)
For this partner project, you will choose a specific ethical issue to address.  Please note that this is an argumentative project and not simply a discussion project.  Your presentation should be 12-15 minutes in length and have a visual element (e.g. PowerPoint). You will also have an additional 10 minutes at the end of your presentation to answer questions and facilitate a class discussion.
Note that this assignment will be presented during weeks 5-10.  You are encouraged to choose a partner and topic this week (see week 5-10 topics). Let your instructor know asap your chosen topic/week.

The following elements must be included in your project presentation:  
1.	The fundamental questions in this ethical issue.  This should be identified and explained early in your presentation along with a few of the prominent views on this issue.
2.	Definitions of relevant terms.
3.	A clear thesis statement which your presentation will focus on and argue for.
4.	The main arguments which you will advance in favour of your thesis.
5.	A few key objections to your thesis along with your responses to them.
6.	An explanation of the significance of this issue in terms of how it impacts society.

Please note that your research for the presentation must include sources which are not Christian or supportive of your position.  This will provide first-hand knowledge of opposing views and the rationale for them.  This knowledge is indispensable in developing your own positions and in understanding others’ perspectives.  
You will be asked to submit your project to the instructor for marking after your presentation.  The format could be in a Word document, PowerPoint, Prezi, or another format.  You may have a maximum of 30 slides in your presentation.  Follow the guidelines in this document: https://assets.prb.org/pdf/ConnectingPeopleSect3.pdf

Here are some more guidelines about Presentations:
Presentations are visual representations of ideas, concepts, innovations, plans, or solutions.  As such they need to be appealing to keep the interest of the audience.  In order to produce good presentations, the following key factors should be considered:
1.	 Presentations should not be read from a paper.  Writing a technical report or paper is a different medium of communication than presenting orally.  The goal of a presentation is to get a few key points across to an audience, not to overwhelm people with details.  Always assume people will read the technical paper if they are interested in doing so.
2.	Presentations must be visually appealing.  Interspersing pictures, video, graphics, charts, tables all help to keep the listener engaged in the presentation.  
3.	Presentations must be readable.  When you choose a font size for a presentation, bigger is always better.  Assume your grandma is looking at the presentation and her eyesight is not as good as it used to be.  In addition, the key words you choose for a presentation should go at the top of the slides.  
4.	Presentations must be succinct.  Most people only have an attention span of a few seconds.  Key points must be emphasized at least 3 times for the audience to get it.  As a result, there are very few points that you can reasonably cover in a presentation.
5.	Presentations must compel through story.  You must find ways to tell a compelling story through your presentation.  People need to emotionally connect to the issue, problem, solution or opportunity that you are presenting.  In order to do this, you need to present a strong and compelling (single idea) story to the audience.
6.	Every presenter can improve.  If you are unsure about a presentation format or style, research online presentations and gauge how they made you feel and how compelling they were.  Learn from what worked in other presentations in order to improve your ability to present meaningfully.  Finally, practice, practice, practice.  You should go through your online presentation one or two times before going live to test everything out, to make sure all the transitions between presenters are smooth.
Here are a couple of final rules for the class presentations:

•	Each group must have a visual presentation, such as a ppt, pdf, Prezi, or some format that will organize their presentation for the class.  
•	Each member of the group must play an active role in the presentation.  They need to take some measurable and observable role in the presentation itself so their involvement can be graded.
•	Presenters should be dressed and equipped for a formal presentation. Presenters should model the presentation as if they are presenting to the board of directors of the company, a public forum, or a community organization that has a problem or is looking to engage an opportunity.
•	Presentations must conclude at the 20 minute mark, and then provide 10 minutes for questions and/or class discussions.  There will be no tolerance for using other people’s time for your presentation.
