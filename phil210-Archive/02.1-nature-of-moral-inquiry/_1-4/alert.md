#### Activity 1.4: Thought Experiment

Read the thought experiment posed by philosopher, Philippa Foot, on page 14 of the Wolff text, *Introduction to Moral Philosophy*. Consider how you might answer the question posed by this thought experiment and why you would answer this way. What ethical issues arise?

*Note that this is an ungraded activity, but you are encouraged to write your answers in your notes. You may be asked to review this case or similar cases in your class discussion groups. This practice of analyzing a case, contemplating various perspectives, and presenting an argument will help you in your assessments for this course.*
