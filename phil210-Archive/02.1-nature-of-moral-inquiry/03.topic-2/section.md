## Topic 2: Moral Reasoning
------------------------

What is moral reasoning or moral discourse? We are involved in moral reasoning
when we engage in a thinking process about what we ought to do in specific
situations. This will mean following a thoughtful procedure for sorting through
moral questions with the goal of discovering correct moral action. But how does
one do this?

One suggested method is the following:

! **Step one**: Identify the precise foundational moral question needing to be resolved. For example, in the debate over the moral permissibility of abortion on demand, the foundational moral question concerns the nature and moral status of the unborn human being. Does it have the same status or value as a 3-year old child or that of a growth which needs to be removed? If this question were resolved and agreed upon by most people, there would be little left to argue about on this question. Admittedly, this is a difficult question but that is often the case in ethics. Itâ€™s why we call them moral dilemmas. The point of identifying the key foundational question/s for each issue is that, then, at least we are thinking about the right questions and not wasting our time on others.

!! **Step two**: State the main answers to this question. This will involve accurately stating the main competing views on this moral question, both the ones we agree with and the ones we do not.

!!! **Step three**: Discover the best arguments or reasons given for each of these answers. The goal is to understand the supporting rationale for each of these positions as well as the people who believe them.

!!!! **Step four**: Evaluate and assess these arguments with the goal of drawing a conclusion of your own concerning which answer is the best one. Normally the way to do step four well is to have done step three carefully. Reading the arguments for one view provides the most helpful material needed to evaluate both it and the opposing views.

In the end, you will find that proper moral reasoning involves applying general
moral principles such as the principles of love, justice, human dignity,
honesty, etc., to specific moral questions in order to see what these principles
tell us about the correct course of action.

Of course, moral reasoning needs to be done with great care. In the text reading
for this topic, we will learn a few principles for careful reasoning. One
important concept in the reading is **logical validity** which occurs when the
conclusion of an argument follows logically from the premises. This means that
if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If an argument,
moral or otherwise, is invalid (i.e., if the conclusion does not follow from the
premises), it proves nothing and should be set aside.

Some other terms are **argument by analogy**, **argument to the best
explanation, moral intuitions, universalization** and the **fact/value
distinction.** Our text will explain them and we will have an opportunity to
think through their importance for careful reasoning with our class colleagues.
