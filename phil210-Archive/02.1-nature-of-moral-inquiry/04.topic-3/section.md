## Topic 3: Cultural Relativism
----------------------------

This topic will introduce us to one of the most perplexing questions about
morality: are moral values consistent for all people regardless of when or where
they happen to live? If so why do moral values seem to vary, sometimes
considerably, in different times and cultures?

**Cultural Relativism** is more than the recognition that moral views and
practices differ from place to place and time to time. It is the view that what
is morally right and wrong should be understood only within a specific cultural
or social setting. Furthermore, what is morally right in one culture may be
wrong in another. In other words it is a view about the very nature of morality.

In chapter 2 of the Wolff *Introduction* text, we will come across a number of
different kinds of relativism and will have the opportunity to learn some
arguments often made in favour of cultural relativism along with a number of
serious problems with it.
