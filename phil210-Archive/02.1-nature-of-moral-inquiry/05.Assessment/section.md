## Checking your Learning
Before you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to:
-	Define key terms, such as meta-ethics, normative ethics, applied ethics, and moral intuition.
-	Describe what it means to think ethically about key moral dilemmas we face in the 21st century.
-	Explain some unique features of moral discourse.
-	Discuss how cultural relativism differs from moral objectivism.
-	Take a position on the issue of cultural relativism, however tentatively, and articulate both the strongest arguments for and some key objections to it.
