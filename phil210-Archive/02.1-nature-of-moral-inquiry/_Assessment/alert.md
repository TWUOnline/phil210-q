### Assignment: Reflective Journal (ungraded practice)

Throughout this course, you will be invited to write about what you are learning
in a Reflective Journal. You should consider your journal as a place for you to
try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and possibly share what you are
learning with your community. For more on Reflective Journaling, see the
following [resource](Reflective_Journaling.pdf).

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to
write a 400-500 word journal entry responding to the following questions:
-   Take one or two of the thought experiments presented in Unit 1 and explain
    briefly the difficulty of the dilemmas.
-   How would moral reasoning help us?  
-   What are two ways principles of moral reasoning could provide direction in
    resolving the dilemmas in the thought experiences?
-   In your response, work with key terms and concepts from your readings.  Show
    how a cultural relativist would approach this issue differently from a moral
    objectivist.
