### Assignment: Ethics Committee Responses (40%)

*Click [here](PHIL-210-Ethics-Committee-Assignment.pdf) for a pdf version of this assignment.*

Throughout this course, you will work with a group of your peers, assuming the
role of an Ethics Committee. This committee will meet several times throughout this
course to discuss issues and then create a summary report.

1.  Group members work together to produce their report; it is one report
    created by each group.

2.  Discuss the case together after reading the relevant pages in the course text.  Then follow this basic structure for your report:

    1.  In the report, begin by **stating concisely the ethical issue, question, dilemma, or case** you are addressing as a committee.  For example: “The issue we are addressing in this report is. . .”

    2.  Then give a brief **explanation of the case** to show you understand it.

    3.  Then state **your recommendation AS A COMMITTEE**.  Do not use “I” in this report.  Use “We” since the report is the recommendation of the whole committee after discussing it.

    4.  Concisely state **WHY you recommend this**.  “We recommend this course of action because ...”  If possible, connect your recommendation to one of the ethical approaches covered in the course text.

Submit your response to your instructor via the Moodle assignment dropbox.

Each report is worth 20%, for a total of 40% of your course grade. You will
complete a Ethics Committee Response for Units 1 and 4.

**Ethics Committee Questions**
------------------------------

### Unit 1: (20%)

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to analyze the following case. You will work with a group of your peers, assuming the role of an Ethics Committee. This committee will meet throughout this course to discuss issues and create a summary report. Four reports are ungraded practice, and four reports are graded for a total of 40% of your course grade. At the end of the course, there will also be a self-reflection worth 5%.

For this first Ethics Committee meeting, you will discuss the following case:

A local manufacturing plant in your community has been accused by a citizens group of dumping waste into a nearby river. When confronted with this issue, the manufacturing company president responded by saying, “We’re not dumping that much in and we’re not hurting anyone.” Others in the community disagree and believe this practice by the manufacturing plant is harming the environment.

In topic 2 of this unit, four steps are set out for working through moral situations like this one. For this Ethics committee report, first figure out what questions you would need to ask the company and what information you would need. Then follow just the first two of the four steps.

· Step 1: identify the precise moral question needing to be resolved, and

· Step 2: state a few possible answers to this question.

Finally, tell which of the answers in step 2 your committee is recommending and why.

As you meet with your Ethics Committee this week, discuss the case above and take notes as a group. In your response, work with key terms and concepts from your readings. *(eg. If I was a ….I would say...about this case.)*

Submit your report on Moodle by the end of the week.

meet with your Ethics Committee and discuss the following:

For the following ethical theories, Justice as fairness, the categorical imperative, and utilitarianism, explain the answer you think an advocate of each position would give to the following question:

*Should the government provide housing and a food allowance for homeless people?*

As you meet with your Ethics Committee this week, discuss the question and provide some of the key reasoning you think each perspective would use in coming to what they believe to be a just solution. In other words, the utilitarian would point out. . . and say. . ., etc.
