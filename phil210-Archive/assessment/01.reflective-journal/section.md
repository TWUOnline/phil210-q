### Assignment: Reflective Journal (20%)
*Click [here](PHIL-210-Reflective-Journal.pdf) for a pdf version of this assignment.*

Throughout this course, you will be invited to write about what you are learning
in a Reflective Journal. You should consider your journal as a place for you to
try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and possibly share what you are
learning with your community.

This assessment is worth 10% of your course grade. Two of your
Reflective Journal entries are graded.  These are from Units 2 and 8 (5% each).

#### Instructions:

There are four steps to submitting your Reflective Journal:

**Step 1:** Respond to the questions presented in the unit.
Base your comments around a few key ideas from the course text reading of the week.  
  a) First pick out 3-4 key ideas (terms, concepts, analogies, viewpoints expressed in the text, etc.),
  b) Second, explain them concisely in a few words or sentences.  Show you understand them, and
  c) Third, give your own reflections on them.  Here are some suggestions for how to do that:
  - Do you agree or disagree?  Why?
  - Do you find the issue esp. difficult, or quite straightforward?  Why?  
  - Do you have any experiences which might provide guidance for you in working through the ethical questions in the text?

**Step 2:** Take notes on key learning from class discussions.

**Step 3:** Continue to work on your grammar and sentence structure.  The goal is to express your ideas as clearly and well as possible.  I would encourage you to show some of your work to the course facilitator for suggestions or seek out the help available at the university center.

**Step 4:** Submit your final Reflective Journal entry to your professor via the Moodle assignment dropbox. Be sure to include any final ideas you learned through the class discussions.


#### Guidelines for Discussion Responses

Take notes during class, so that you can add these ideas in your reflective journal assignments, highlighting what you learned from the discussion with your peers.

Be sure to respond substantively.

*Substantive responses may include:*

-   Providing a new thought, idea, or perspective;

-   Citing an experience or example of what we are learning;

-   Adding a new twist on a perspective;

-   Critically thinking about an idea/concept;

-   Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective;

-   Asking a question or making a comment that shows you are interested in what
    another person says or encourages another person to elaborate on something
    they have already said;

-   Sharing a resource (a reading, web link, video) not covered in the syllabus
    that adds new information or perspectives to our learning;

-   Making a comment that underscores the link between two people’s
    contributions and making this link explicit in your comment. Or making a
    summary observation that takes into account several people’s contributions
    and that touches on a recurring theme in the discussion.

What Substantive Participation is **NOT:**

-   Very basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree;”

-   Restating what has been said *(unless there is a direct purpose in doing
    so);*

-   Disrespectfully disagreeing;

-   Pat answers that are not thought-provoking or do not move the dialogue
    forward;

Below are examples of how to stimulate your own and others’ thinking:

-   What would happen if…

-   Other times it may be helpful to…

-   It is my understanding…what is your experience with this?

-   You might approach this from…

-   Is it possible that…

-   Would you consider…

-   Maybe…

-   Possibly…

-   Sometimes…

-   I’m wondering if…

-   Do you think…

#### Assignment Submission

Assignments should be submitted on Moodle by the end of the week (confirm date
with your Facilitator). Be sure to include your initial journal response, as
well as ideas from your class discussion.

#### Grading Rubric:

Here are the grading criteria that will be used to mark your journal and
discussions:

**Unit Questions**
------------------

### Unit 2: (10%)

For your first Reflective Journal in this course, you are invited to write
about what you have learned in this unit. Remember that you should consider your
journal as a place for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and
to possibly share what you are learning with your community.

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to
write a 250-300 word journal entry that compares and contrasts the different perspectives covered in this unit and how these perspectives would impact how one might respond to an unethical activity.
