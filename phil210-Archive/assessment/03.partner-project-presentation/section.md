### Assignment: Partner Project Presentation (40%)
*Click [here](PHIL-210-Partner-Project-Presentation-2.pdf) for a pdf version of this assignment.*

For this partner project, your group will choose a specific ethical issue to address.
Please note that this is an argumentative project and not simply a discussion
project. Your presentation should be 12-15 minutes in length and have a visual
element (e.g. PowerPoint). You will also have an additional 10 minutes at the
end of your presentation to answer questions and facilitate a class discussion.

Note that this assignment will be presented during weeks 5-10. You are
encouraged to choose a group and topic this week (see week 3-10 topics). Let
your instructor know asap your chosen topic/week.

The following elements must be included in your project presentation:

1.  The fundamental **questions** in this ethical issue. This should be
    identified and explained early in your presentation along with a few of the
    prominent views on this issue.

2.  **Definitions** of relevant terms.

3.  A clear **thesis statement** which your presentation will focus on and argue
    for.

4.  The main **arguments** which you will advance in favour of your thesis.

5.  A few key **objections** to your thesis along with your responses to them.

6.  An **explanation** of the significance of this issue in terms of how it
    impacts society.

Please note that your research for the presentation must include sources which
are not Christian or supportive of your position. This will provide first-hand
knowledge of opposing views and the rationale for them. This knowledge is
indispensable in developing your own positions and in understanding others’
perspectives.

You will be asked to submit your project to the instructor for marking after
your presentation. The format could be in a Word document, Powerpoint, Prezi, or
another format. You may have a maximum of 30 slides in your presentation. Follow
the guidelines in this document:

*Here are some more guidelines about Presentations:*

**Presentations are visual representations of ideas, concepts, innovations,
plans, or solutions. As such they need to be appealing to keep the interest of
the audience. In order to produce good presentations, the following key factors
should be considered:**

1.  **Presentations should not be read from a paper.** Writing a technical
    report or paper is a different medium of communication than presenting
    orally. The goal of a presentation is to get a few key points across to an
    audience, not to overwhelm people with details. Always assume people will
    read the technical paper if they are interested in doing so.

2.  **Presentations must be visually appealing.** Interspersing pictures, video,
    graphics, charts, tables all help to keep the listener engaged in the
    presentation.

3.  **Presentations must be readable.** When you choose a font size for a
    presentation, bigger is always better. Assume your grandma is looking at the
    presentation and her eyesight is not as good as it used to be. In addition,
    the key words you choose for a presentation should go at the top of the
    slides.

4.  **Presentations must be succinct.** Most people only have an attention span
    of a few seconds. Key points must be emphasized at least 3 times for the
    audience to get it. As a result, there are very few points that you can
    reasonably cover in a presentation.

5.  **Presentations must compel through story.** You must find ways to tell a
    compelling story through your presentation. People need to emotionally
    connect to the issue, problem, solution or opportunity that you are
    presenting. In order to do this, you need to present a strong and compelling
    (single idea) story to the audience.

6.  **Every presenter can improve.** If you are unsure about a presentation
    format or style, research online presentations and gauge how they made you
    feel and how compelling they were. Learn from what worked in other
    presentations in order to improve your ability to present meaningfully.
    Finally, practice, practice, practice. You should go through your online
    presentation one or two times before going live to test everything out, to
    make sure all the transitions between presenters are smooth.

**Here are a couple of final rules for the class presentations:**

1.  Each group must have a visual presentation, such as a ppt, pdf, Prezi, or
    some format that will organize their presentation for the class.

2.  Each member of the group must play an active role in the presentation. They
    need to take some measurable and observable role in the presentation itself
    so their involvement can be graded.

3.  Presenters should be dressed and equipped for a formal presentation.
    Presenters should model the presentation as if they are presenting to the
    board of directors of the company, a public forum, or a community
    organization that has a problem or is looking to engage an opportunity.

4.  Presentations must conclude at the 15 minute mark, and then provide 10
    minutes for questions and/or class discussions. There will be no tolerance
    for using other people’s time for your presentation.

See the rubric below for details on how your project presentation will be
graded.
