### Assignment: Ethics Committee Response (10%)

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to
meet with your Ethics Committee and complete the following:

Produce a one-page report stating, first, what you believe to be the moral
**basis/foundation** for freedom of speech, and, second, any **examples** where
free speech should be limited. Â Thirdly, provide your **rationale** for each
example of a limitation and show how it still fits with your stated foundation
for free speech.

As you collaborate on this assignment, be sure to refer to the **grading
