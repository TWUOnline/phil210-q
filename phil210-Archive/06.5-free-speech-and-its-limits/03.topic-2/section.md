Topic 2: Pornography and Limits on Free Speech
----------------------------------------------

If we agree that the right to free speech has a sound moral basis, does this
mean it is an absolute right with no exceptions? Or could there be certain
limitations placed on it even while maintaining it as a genuine right? In other
words, how far does this right go? If certain limitations are legitimate, what
are they and what basis could be given for them?
*Disagreement* appears to be a weak basis for limiting free speech. The fact that some people *disagree* with something you or I believe hardly seems like a proper reason to limit our free expression of that belief. Virtually every view point has its detractors and if we followed this principle consistently, it would lead to the collapse of the right to free speech. If, however, *disagreement* does not constitute a good reason for limiting free speech, then what does?
In our second reading, we turn to this question. Catherine MacKinnon, an American lawyer and activist, presents us with a case in which she believes free speech ought to be limited, namely, pornography. She will argue both that free speech is important but that it should be limited in this one case. It will be important for us to follow her argument for both claims and consider our own stance toward them.
