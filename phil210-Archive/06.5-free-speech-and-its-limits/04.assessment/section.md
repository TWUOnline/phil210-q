Before you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to:

-   Describe limitations on freedom of expression suggested by John Stuart Mill
    and his rationale for such limits.
-   Discuss why some who still favour freedom of speech believe pornography
    should not be freely distributed.
-   Show how John Stuart Mill’s Harm Principle is foundational to the question
    of when and why limits should be placed on free speech.
