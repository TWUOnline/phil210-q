### Ethics Video Assignment: Choose Your Topic (15%)

For this assignment, you’ll be asked to create a 2 minute video articulating a
moral viewpoint on one of the following issues: free speech, sexual morality,
abortion, euthanasia, or torture. Then, drawing upon the
readings, make a concise case for this viewpoint.

Your video must include the following elements:
-   A clear statement of the ethical issue being addressed: what is the ethical
    question at hand?
-   Your proposed answer to this question.
-   At least one reason for your answer.
-   A professional and well-prepared appearance to the video as a whole: this
    may require rehearsing it once or twice.
This video must be posted on Moodle by the end of week 9.  If you choose to post it online outside of Moodle (e.g. YouTube), please provide the URL. **You will write 3 posts (150 words each) responding to three videos presented by your classmates, stating your agreement or disagreement with the arguments in the video, and explaining why you agree or disagree.**
