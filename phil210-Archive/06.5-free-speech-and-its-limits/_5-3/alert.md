#### Activity 5.3: Controversial Speaker Case Study

Read and analyse the following case study.
!!! A controversial person is coming to your community planning on giving a public lecture in the community hall.  The event which has been widely publicized has drawn protests from those who are petitioning the organizers to cancel the event.  They argue that this speaker’s views are offensive and should be neither tolerated nor even publicly expressed. From the course readings, how do you think John Stuart Mill would respond if he were one of the organizers?  Tell why you believe he would respond this way. Do you agree with him? Why or why not?
*Note that you may be asked to review this case or similar cases in your class
discussion groups. You may want to prepare by relating the case to your
readings. Specifically, identify the ethical issues and terms to help explain
the case.*
