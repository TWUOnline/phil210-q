#### Activity 3.2: Wallet Case Study

**Introduction**

Read the following case study and answer the questions in your learning journal.
!!! You are out for a walk in the park when you suddenly spot a wallet lying in the grass.  Someone has lost it. Upon opening it, you find the I.D. of the owner and contact information; it is someone of whom you have never heard.  You also find a substantial amount of cash. You have a number of options: leave the wallet alone and continue walking, mail it back to the owner with all its contents inside, or pocket the cash and either mail the wallet back or leave it on the grass.  If you take the cash, no one will ever know. You think back to your ethics course and realize there are a number of perspectives on your situation.
For this case study, how would a psychological egoist, an ethical egoist, and an advocate of self-interest morality answer the following question: should you pocket the cash?  Explain why they would each answer as they do.
