Topic 2: Social Contract Morality
---------------------------------

The second topic related to our question, why be moral, could hardly be more
different from the first. It comes under the heading, Social Contract Morality,
and suggests that moral rules in any society are the result of a social
contract, usually implicit, made between all members of the society. We realize,
say advocates of this theory, that it is in everyone’s interests to develop
ethical rules which are to the benefit of all people, and teach them throughout
society. No society could function if everyone did as they wished. Might would
make right, thugs would rule, and life for those who survived would be filled
with fear and exhaustion.

We’ve seen the difference between the social contract theory and the previous
egoistic ones but can you also see a fundamental similarity between them? This
theory also teaches that the reason we should be moral is that it is in our best
interest to do so. As you read the section in the course text on The Social
Contract, reflect further on this similarity and also on whether it provides an
adequate basis for us to be moral. What problems or questions does it raise?
