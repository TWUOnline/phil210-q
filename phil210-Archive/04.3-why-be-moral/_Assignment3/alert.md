### Assignment: Partner Project Presentation (30%)

For this partner project, you will choose a specific ethical issue to address.
Please note that this is an argumentative project and not simply a discussion
project. Your presentation should be 12-15 minutes in length and have a visual
element (e.g. PowerPoint). You will also have an additional 10 minutes at the
end of your presentation to answer questions and facilitate a class discussion.

Note that this assignment will be presented during weeks 5-10. You must choose a partner and topic this week (see Units 5-10 topics). Your Facilitator will hand out a sign-up sheet.  Complete this before moving on to the next unit.

See more assignment details, including the *grading criteria* in the Assessments section of this course.
