#### Activity 3.5: Ethics Committee Response (ungraded)

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to
analyze Plato’s story of the Ring of Gyges from various perspectives. You will
work again with your Ethics Committee group to discuss and analyze the case.

For this Ethics Committee meeting, analyze Plato’s story of the Ring of Gyges (from the text reading, p. 88) and state how his key question, “What would you do?” might be answered by an ethical egoist, a psychological egoist, an advocate of self-interest morality, and a kin altruist.  Then explain why you think each would answer as they do. (e.g. *If I was a ….I would say...  Here is why.)*

As you meet with your Ethics Committee this week, discuss the story and take
notes. In your response, work with key terms and concepts from your readings.
(eg. *If I was a ….I would say...about this case.*)
