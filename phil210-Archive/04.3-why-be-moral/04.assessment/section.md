Assessment
----------
### Sign-up for the Partner Project Presentation

For this partner project, your group will choose a specific ethical issue to address.
Please note that this is an argumentative project and not simply a discussion
project. Your presentation should be 12-15 minutes in length and have a visual
element (e.g. PowerPoint). You will also have an additional 10 minutes at the
end of your presentation to answer questions and facilitate a class discussion.

Note that this assignment will be presented during weeks 5-10. You must choose a group and topic this week (see Units 3-10 topics). Your Facilitator will hand out a sign-up sheet.  Complete this before moving on to the next unit.

See more assignment details, including the *grading criteria* in the Assessments section of this course.

### Checking your Learning
----------------------

Before you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to:
-   Explain key ethical concepts such as ethical egoism, psychological egoism,
    self-interest morality, and kin altruism.
-   Discuss knowledgeably Platoâ€™s famous story of the Ring of Gyges.
-   Discuss whether people would do what is right, even if no one would find
    out.
