Topic 1: Egoism
---------------

The first topic related to the question, why be moral, comes under the heading of Egoism. There are two kinds of egoism which we will examine, **psychological egoism** and **ethical egoism,** and the discussion of these concepts may surprise you. The theories developed around them are similar in certain respects yet give significantly different answers to the question, why be moral.

**Psychological egoism**, as its name suggests, is a psychological theory about human behaviour and claims that we, humans, cannot help but pursue that which is in our own best interest. It’s not difficult to see what this means for our question, why be moral. If this theory is correct, it would make it virtually impossible for anyone to act morally *unless she believed it was in her own best interest to do so*. It will be important to reflect on this theory in the reading to see if it merits our acceptance.

**Ethical egoism**, as its name indicates, is an ethical theory which teaches
that we have a right, and possibly even a duty, to pursue our own
self-interests. Following our self-interests is the morally right thing to do.

Our text book identifies two distinct forms of ethical egoism. According to one
form, acting in our own self-interest is the best way of advancing the good of
others around us because it is in our self-interest to do good for others. A
society works better when we all look out for the good of others; thus it is in
our best interest to act this way and promote this kind of society.

A different form of ethical egoism, however, holds that it is morally right to act in our own best interests, *regardless of the consequences of others*. The best known proponent of this kind of pure ethical egoism is the Russian-American philosopher and novelist, Ayn Rand, who referred to the “duty of selfishness.” We will read briefly about her views in the text reading for this topic.

As we read the chapter on egoism in the Wolff text, think carefully about the
implications this theory, if true, would have for our question, why be moral.
