## Topic 2: Utilitarianism

**Introduction**
Another answer to the question of how to determine what is moral is called **utilitarianism**. This view teaches that morally good actions are those that, on balance, bring about the greatest good or happiness in any given situation. This theory seems rather intuitive to many people and, not surprisingly, has been around for a long time. Nineteenth century British philosopher, John Stuart Mill, its best known representative, has written the article we’ll read to see how he develops it.
As you’re reading his article, ask yourself if you can think of any problems with it. Serious objections have been raised against this view which is why many people have preferred the next answer we will consider.
