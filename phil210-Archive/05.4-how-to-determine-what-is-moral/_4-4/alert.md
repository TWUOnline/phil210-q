#### Activity 4.4: Diamond Case Study

Read the following case study and consider what you would do in the situation.
What ethical issues arise?
!!! You, a follower of utilitarian ethics and a poor college student, are enjoying an evening visiting with two friends.  One is a parent of seven children with limited financial means who holds to Immanuel Kant’s categorical imperative, while the other is a wealthy business owner who happens to be a follower of John Rawls’ theory of justice built around the concept of the original position.  Your topic of discussion is the relative merits of these three ethical concepts. Suddenly someone enters the room with a small box of valuable diamonds and says they have been donated to your group of three by a wealthy philanthropist who wishes to remain anonymous. The donor asked that they be divided “justly” among you but has left the definition of justice up to you.  How would each of you say they should be divided? How does each ethical concept, the categorical imperative, the original position, and utilitarianism influence each answer?
