Unit 4: How to Determine What is Moral
==========================================

![](thinker-1294493_640.jpg)


Overview
--------

Have you ever had a disagreement with someone over what the correct ethical
action or point of view is in a certain situation? Perhaps, for example, a
person who has murdered three people and terrorized your community for the past
four months has just been arrested and found guilty with overwhelming evidence.
You say justice requires that this person be executed but your friend staunchly
disagrees. She argues that killing humans is wrong in all situations because
human life has intrinsic value and dignity regardless of what any person has
done.
Another example: you and a friend disagree about whether you should tell a lie to your employer in order to save a colleague’s job who has been unfairly accused of padding her expense account. It’s a complicated situation but by telling one small lie, you can lift the suspicion from your colleague. “Of course you should lie!” your friend confidently asserts. “After all, it would be a gross injustice for her to be fired for something she didn’t do, and what harm is there is telling the lie to prevent that injustice?” You, however, are not so sure that lying is really that harmless.
Disagreements like this can arise over a host of morally perplexing dilemmas and when they do, we sometimes wonder how to resolve them.

This is the question we will be addressing in this unit, i.e., **how can we decide what good ethical behaviour is when we are faced with tough ethical choices?** Is there a procedure, or set of procedures, we can follow to help provide ethical guidance for the perplexing moral questions we all face from time to time? In other words, what does morality call us to do in these tough situations and how can we determine that?

There are three common theories of morality which set out answers to this question: **Justice as Fairness, Utilitarianism,** and **The Categorical Imperative**. In this unit we will read articles setting out each of these theories along with a basic rationale for each.
