Topic 1: Understanding the Original Position
--------------------------------------------

How can we decide what good ethical behaviour is when we are faced with tough
ethical choices? One answer, or theory of morality, called **‘Justice as
Fairness’**, holds that the morally good, or just, course of action is the one
which is the fairest in the situation. How, though, do we figure out what is
fair, especially in a way that others will agree with us? How could anyone
figure out a thing like that?
Interestingly, John Rawls, a twentieth century American political philosopher, and an advocate of this view, has developed a well-known thought experiment to help us do precisely that. We will read about it in the article by him in our course readings for this unit. Be ready to figure out what he meant by such key terms as **the original position** and **veil of ignorance**. Without a clear grasp of these, we will not understand this thought experiment or Rawls’ method.
We may need to read over certain parts a few times to really grasp these key concepts but, given the importance of preparing to face tough moral dilemmas, it will be worth the effort. We’ll also have opportunities to discuss them with colleagues in this class to help gain a working knowledge of them. In the end, let’s try to answer the question for ourselves: How can I determine what is moral?
