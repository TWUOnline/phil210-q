#### Activity 4.5: Ethics Simulation (Optional)

Now that you have learned about the main ethical theories and principles, look
for opportunities to challenge yourself! Look up ethical case studies or
simulations online and see if you can provide sound reasoning and link to the
theories you have learned.
One app in particular you may want to try is Ethical Decision Making (below). It helps you go through the options to make tough ethical decisions.
