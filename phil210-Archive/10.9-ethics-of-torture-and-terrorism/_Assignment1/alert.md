### Assignment: Reflective Journal (ungraded practice)
After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write about what you have learned in this unit. Remember that you should consider your journal as a place for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and to share what you are learning with your community.
Write a 250-400 word journal response discussing the reasons Alan Dershowitz believes that, in certain cases, torture is morally permissible when carried out under rigorous regulations.  Then show how he believes his view follows from a utilitarian perspective. Following that, analyze his view and formulate two searching questions you think he would need to answer to defend his view further.  Finally, tell how you think a different utilitarian thinker could argue against the moral permissibility of torture?

#### Discussion Responses
After you have finished your journal assignment, you will share your responses in class with your peers. As you discuss, be sure to respond substantively.
