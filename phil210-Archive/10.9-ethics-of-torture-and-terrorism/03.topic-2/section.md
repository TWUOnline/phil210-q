Topic 2: A Rationale for Terrorism: A Response.  
-------------------------------------------------
In this topic, we are shifting focus from torture to terrorism and this raises an immediate question: Isn’t terrorism simply evil through and through? Shouldn’t people who commit acts of terrorism be caught and locked up, and shouldn’t that be the end of the matter? If so, then why are we discussing this issue in a course on ethics? What is there to discuss about the ethics of this practice?
Surprisingly, certain people have offered justifications for acts of terrorism under certain conditions, complete with arguments and lines of reasoning. In this topic, we will have an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with some of them through reading an article by Michael Walzer, an American political philosopher who has worked a great deal on issues of social justice. In this article, he has articulated a number of the arguments that are sometimes offered in support of certain acts of terrorism along with his own critiques of them. Once we have understood them, we’ll be in a position to assess them.
