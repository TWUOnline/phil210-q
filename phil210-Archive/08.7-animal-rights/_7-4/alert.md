#### Activity 7.4: Case Study

For this case study, analyze Peter Singer’s well-known contention that the vital characteristic that gives a being the right to equal consideration is not the **ability to reason**, as is commonly assumed, but rather the **capacity for suffering.** To review this, see his article in the course readings (pages 429-432).  Do you agree with this contention? Why or why not? State also whether you agree with the principle he derives from this contention, namely, that the principle of equality which we commonly apply to humans should be extended to other species. If you agree with this, explain why. If you do not agree, explain why. In either case, draw upon the concepts and principles from both Immanuel Kant’s and Roger Scruton’s articles.
*Note that you may be asked to review this case or similar cases in your class discussion groups. You may want to prepare by relating the case to your readings. Specifically, identify the ethical issues and terms to help explain the case.*
