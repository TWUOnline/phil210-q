### Assignment: Ethics Committee Response (15%)

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to
meet with your Ethics Committee and create a response to the following:

!!! A strongly worded editorial has just appeared in a local newspaper accusing the community zoo, and all zoos, of violating the rights of animals. Among other things, the author of the article pointedly asked, “How would we like it if we were the ones being confined in this way? It’s not natural for humans and it’s not for animals either.”

A group is now lobbying the city council to shut down the zoo and the council has turned to your ethics committee for a recommendation. Your task is to write a brief report in which you do the following things:

· Define the concept of a right.

· State whether or not animals have rights. Tell why you answer as you do.

· If animals do have rights, does the practice of keeping them in zoos violate their rights. Again, give a reason for your answer.

As you collaborate on this assignment, be sure to refer to the **grading
criteria** in the Assessments section of this course. Submit your report on
Moodle by the end of the week.
