### GRADING GUIDELINES
Following is a description of the letter grading:

| **A range = Superior, exceptional, outstanding**. A+ 90-100%  A 85-89%  A- 80-84% | The assignment demonstrates critical, informed, and creative theological inquiry that reflects superior understanding of essential theological/historical concepts. This means the student demonstrates depth of insight beyond what is normally expected. Carefully nuanced reasoning and writing, free from material, structural and grammatical error are presupposed in this grade. |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **B range = Good.**  B+ 77-79%    B 73-76%    B- 70-72%                       | The assignment demonstrates ready command of full range of concepts and shows some critical, informed, and creative inquiry that reflects above average understanding of essential theological/historical concepts. This means the student has produced an assignment that is free from material, structural and grammatical errors.                                                    |
| **C range = Acceptable.**    C+ 67-69%  C 63-66%    C- 60-62%                | The assignment demonstrates satisfactory ability to describe overall picture and essential concepts. This means the student has completed the assignment in a manner involving no significant errors. Material may not be free from structural and grammatical errors. Nuanced reasoning is not demonstrated.                                                                           |
| **D range = Below average**.    D+ 57-59%   D 53-56%    D- 50-52%           | The assignment demonstrates reasoning that is neither carefully nuanced nor coherently presented; writing is insufficient in depth of insight and/or use of texts; presentation is not free from material error in structure, spelling and grammar. This means that the student failed to respond adequately to the assignment and its intentions.                                      |
| **F = Unsatisfactory**.
