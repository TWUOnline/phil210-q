title: 'Facilitation notes'
---

In this section, we will outline a couple of key ideas to consider as you facilitate this course.  See below for advice on setting up your class schedule, facilitating activities and discussions, and guiding students through assessments.

## Class Schedule
Note that students will do part of the learning online, and part in the classroom.  This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing the course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments for the next class.  In class, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them further engage with the course material.

## Online Activities
Before each class, students are encouraged to view the entire unit that will be discussed that week.  They need to read the textbook chapters, the overviews provided by the instructor, and engage in several learning activities.  Learning activities include questions that we ask students to answer in a Reflective Journal (graded and ungraded), videos that explain topics further, and an ungraded key terms quiz. As you preview the week ahead with your class, point out activities that they must complete before they come to your class (e.g. Reflective journal due Wednesday in order to participate in discussion and submit to instructor on Moodle by Friday.


## Class Assignments & Learning Activities
Note that many classes will be devoted to certain assignments (discussions, ethics committee, presentations).  On the next page are the assignment details. Please refer to the course in Moodle for specifics.

For assignment submission, students will submit via the assignment dropboxes in Moodle.


### Key Terms Review Activities
In addition to discussions, presentations, and preparing for assessments, you may want to practice key terms with the class.
Each unit has a key terms matching activity.  If there is class time (e.g. for an ice-breaker opening activity or the close of a lesson), engage students in some vocabulary activities.  

Here are a couple of examples:

- Word Sort: See instructions in [Faculty Focus: A New Way to Help Students Learn Course Vocabulary](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/effective-teaching-strategies/a-new-way-to-help-students-learn-course-vocabulary/)
- Semantic maps, Vocab on the Move, Brain Power Words: See instructions in [21 Ideas for Teaching Vocabulary](http://www.giftedguru.com/21_ideas_for_teaching_vocabulary/)
- [Vocabulary Building](https://www.saddleback.edu/tutoring/vocabulary-building)
- Guess Who? Prepare name tag stickers with philosophy perspectives (e.g. nihilist, moral subjectivist, moral objectivist, free will advocate, determinist, and compatibilist, utilitarian, etc.). Put the sticker on students backs and have them mingle, trying to guess from other's desciption what perspective they have.
