### Facilitation Guide

# PHIL 210: Contemporary Ethical Issues

This guide will give you an overview of the course, including the syllabus, suggested facilitation strategies, and instructor notes. Please also review in detail the course contents in Moodle. Another key resource for every Facilitator is the TWU Faculty instructor of record. Please ensure you have set up a meeting weeks before the class begins.
